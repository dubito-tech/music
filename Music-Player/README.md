# Music Player
Music Player is a somewhat simple project that allows you to play music in your browser or on your phone in the background.

## How To Use
It's simple! All you have to do is press that giant play button and you're off! To switch between songs, just press the right or left arrow to do so! Or you can just wait for the song to end, and it'll just automatically go to the next song.

## Adjustments
You can edit what songs will play in the folder labeled `mp3`. You can change the covers for the songs in `covers`. To add a song use this format inside of `script.js`:
```js
{
  name: "put-the-song-name-here",
  artist: "put-the-artist-name-here",
  cover: "covers/put-a-cover-file-here",
  source: "mp3/put-an-audio-file-here",
  favorited: false
}
```
